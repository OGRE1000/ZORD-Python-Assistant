# AI Assistant using Python

This repository contains a **mini AI Assistant project** developed using **Python**, created during my initial learning phase of the Python programming language.

The assistant is designed to perform various user-driven tasks through commands, including opening applications, sending emails and messages, and providing information using external APIs.

## Key Features
- Command-based task execution  
- Email and messaging support  
- Text-to-speech functionality  
- Information retrieval  
- Modular and extensible design  

## Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- PyCharm IDE  
- Python Libraries: smtplib, Twilio API, OpenCV, pyttsx3, PyAudio, datetime, Folium, Wikipedia API  

## Purpose
This project was developed to:
- Understand Python fundamentals  
- Explore automation and AI-based assistants  
- Gain hands-on experience with APIs and libraries  

## Future Enhancements
- Machine Learning and NLP integration  
- Voice recognition and synthesis  
- IoT and smart device integration  
- Continuous learning and adaptability
